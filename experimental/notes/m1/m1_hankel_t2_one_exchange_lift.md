Agent/model: Codex acting autonomously through AllenGrahamHart.

## Purpose

This note extracts the first small theorem promised by the M1 Hankel packet
audit: the `t=2` determinant gate and the same-slope one-exchange lift.  The
point is to separate a local collision mechanism that should be charged to a
higher-slack/root-slice ledger, rather than left as unexplained primitive slope
growth.

## Setup

Work with the quotient-normal rank-one target from
`m1_exact_target_v0.md`.  Let `C=RS[F,H,k]`, `|H|=n`, `r=n-k`, and fix

```text
t=2,        a=k+2,        j=n-a=r-2.
```

For a complement `T subset H`, `|T|=j`, write

```text
ell_T(X)=prod_{x in T}(X-x).
```

For a quotient-normal pair `(phi,Y)`, put

```text
a_T = H_{2,j}(Syn(Y)) ell_T,
b_T = H_{2,j}(Syn(phi)) ell_T        in F^2.
```

Here `phi=-g` and `Y=f` in the original line notation.

## Determinant Gate

A complement `T` contributes a finite noncontained slope if and only if

```text
b_T != 0,        a_T = lambda b_T for some lambda in F.
```

Equivalently,

```text
b_T != 0,        det[a_T b_T]=0.
```

When this happens, the finite slope `lambda` is unique.

Proof: the Hankel predicate is

```text
(H_{2,j}(Syn(Y))-lambda H_{2,j}(Syn(phi))) ell_T=0,
```

which is exactly `a_T=lambda b_T`.  The noncontained condition is
`b_T!=0`.  Since `b_T` is a nonzero vector in `F^2`, the scalar is unique when
it exists, and existence is equivalent to rank one of the two columns.

## Same-Slope One-Exchange Lift

Suppose two distinct complements

```text
T_x = R union {x},        T_y = R union {y},        x != y,
```

both contribute the same finite slope `lambda`.  Put

```text
w_lambda = Y - lambda phi.
```

Then the common core `R` satisfies the higher-slack Hankel recurrence

```text
H_{3,j-1}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_R = 0.          (core-lift)
```

Proof: since both complements have slope `lambda`,

```text
H_{2,j}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_{T_x}=0,
H_{2,j}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_{T_y}=0.
```

Writing

```text
ell_{T_x}=(X-x)ell_R,        ell_{T_y}=(X-y)ell_R,
```

and subtracting gives

```text
(y-x) H_{2,j}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_R=0.
```

Thus rows `0` and `1` of the recurrence vanish on `ell_R`.  Combining this
with either equation for `(X-x)ell_R` also gives rows `1` and `2`.  Hence rows
`0,1,2` vanish on `ell_R`, which is (core-lift).

If

```text
H_{3,j-1}(Syn(phi)) ell_R != 0,
```

then the same slope is noncontained on the larger support `H\R`.  If this
direction vector is zero, the collision has moved into the contained/tangent
side on the core.  In both cases, a same-slope one-exchange collision is not a
free primitive packet: it is visible in the next-slack/core ledger.

## Triangle Packets

The next local shape is a pairwise one-exchange triangle in one fixed-slope
fiber.  In the Johnson graph on `j`-complements, every such triangle is one of
two types:

1. a star triangle with common `(j-1)`-core `R`;
2. a top triangle contained in a common `(j+1)`-set `U`.

Indeed, if `T_1` and `T_2` share a `(j-1)`-core `R`, then a third complement
one-exchange adjacent to both either contains `R` (the star case) or replaces
one element of `R` by the two outside elements of `T_1 union T_2` (the top
case).

Let again `w_lambda=Y-lambda phi`, and suppose every complement in the
triangle has slope `lambda`.  In the star case, the one-exchange core lift
already gives

```text
H_{3,j-1}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_R = 0.
```

In the top case, write `T=U\{x}` for any one member of the triangle.  Since
`ell_U=(X-x)ell_T` and `H_{2,j}(Syn(w_lambda))ell_T=0`,

```text
H_{1,j+1}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_U = 0.
```

Thus a top triangle lies in the common lifted `t=1` Hankel kernel of its top
set `U`.  This is the local packet form of the statement that residual top
packets are not independent slope growth; they have moved to a lower-row
Hankel kernel that must be charged separately.

There is a sharper statement for full top packets.  Suppose a `(j+1)`-set `U`
has every `j`-subcomplement

```text
T_x = U\{x},        x in U,
```

active at the same slope.  The polynomials

```text
ell_{T_x} = ell_U/(X-x),        x in U,
```

form a basis of the vector space of polynomials of degree at most `j`.  Since
the two Hankel rows vanish on each `ell_{T_x}`, they vanish on every degree
`<=j` polynomial.  Hence all syndrome coordinates

```text
Syn_0(w_lambda), ..., Syn_{j+1}(w_lambda)
```

are zero.  But in the `t=2` row, `r=n-k=j+2`.  Therefore

```text
Syn(w_lambda)=0.
```

Equivalently, `w_lambda in C`.  Full top packets are thus global-codeword
slopes, belonging to the contained/tangent ledger rather than to residual
primitive top-packet growth.

Consequently, for `Syn(w_lambda) != 0`, a top set `U` has at most `j` active
`j`-subcomplements.  Thus nonzero top packets are partial packets of size at
most `j`; they cannot contain the full `(j+1)`-clique, and their local
same-slope support multiplicity is linearly bounded by the complement size.

## Exact Verifier

The script

```text
python3 experimental/scripts/verify_m1_hankel_t2_one_exchange_lift.py
```

checks the determinant gate against the slope-loop Hankel classifier and then
verifies the one-exchange core lift for every same-slope edge in two exact
tiny scans.

| field/domain | quotient pairs | supports | max bad | max primitive | max slope fiber | lifted one-exchange cores |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `F_5`, `H=F_5^*`, `n=4,k=1,a=3,j=1` | 15625 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 3480 |
| `F_7`, `H=F_7^*`, `n=6,k=3,a=5,j=1` | 117649 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 34650 |

In both scans every lifted core was still noncontained on the larger support:

```text
lifted_direction_zero_core_edges = 0.
```

The triangle-packet verifier

```text
python3 experimental/scripts/verify_m1_hankel_t2_triangle_packets.py
```

enumerates the combined syndrome `Syn(w_lambda)` directly, so it can check the
first genuine top-triangle case without a slow quotient-pair scan.

| field/domain | syndromes | one-exchange edges | star triangles | top triangles | full top cliques | max nonzero top active |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `F_5`, `H=F_5^*`, `n=4,k=1,a=3,j=1` | 125 | 6 | 4 | 0 | 6 | 1 |
| `F_7`, `H=F_7^*`, `n=6,k=2,a=4,j=2` | 2401 | 420 | 420 | 20 | 20 | 2 |
| `F_7`, `H=F_7^*`, `n=6,k=3,a=5,j=1` | 343 | 15 | 20 | 0 | 15 | 1 |

The `F_7,k=2,j=2` scan is the first exact top-packet check in this file.  It
finds twenty top triangles, all on the zero combined syndrome.  This is not an
asymptotic claim, but it is a useful falsification check: in the smallest
genuine top case, nonzero same-slope triangles are already star/root-slice
events, while full top events are confined to the global-codeword/tangent
ledger.

These are small exact checks, not asymptotic evidence.  Their role is to make
the first `t=2` collision charges reproducible before moving to larger packet
scans and variable-line components.
