## Purpose

This note extracts the first small theorem promised by the M1 Hankel packet
audit: the `t=2` determinant gate and the same-slope one-exchange lift.  The
point is to separate a local collision mechanism that should be charged to a
higher-slack/root-slice ledger, rather than left as unexplained primitive slope
growth.

## Setup

Work with the quotient-normal rank-one target from
`m1_exact_target_v0.md`.  Let `C=RS[F,H,k]`, `|H|=n`, `r=n-k`, and fix

```text
t=2,        a=k+2,        j=n-a=r-2.
```

For a complement `T subset H`, `|T|=j`, write

```text
ell_T(X)=prod_{x in T}(X-x).
```

For a quotient-normal pair `(phi,Y)`, put

```text
a_T = H_{2,j}(Syn(Y)) ell_T,
b_T = H_{2,j}(Syn(phi)) ell_T        in F^2.
```

Here `phi=-g` and `Y=f` in the original line notation.

## Determinant Gate

A complement `T` contributes a finite noncontained slope if and only if

```text
b_T != 0,        a_T = lambda b_T for some lambda in F.
```

Equivalently,

```text
b_T != 0,        det[a_T b_T]=0.
```

When this happens, the finite slope `lambda` is unique.

Proof: the Hankel predicate is

```text
(H_{2,j}(Syn(Y))-lambda H_{2,j}(Syn(phi))) ell_T=0,
```

which is exactly `a_T=lambda b_T`.  The noncontained condition is
`b_T!=0`.  Since `b_T` is a nonzero vector in `F^2`, the scalar is unique when
it exists, and existence is equivalent to rank one of the two columns.

## Same-Slope One-Exchange Lift

Suppose two distinct complements

```text
T_x = R union {x},        T_y = R union {y},        x != y,
```

both contribute the same finite slope `lambda`.  Put

```text
w_lambda = Y - lambda phi.
```

Then the common core `R` satisfies the higher-slack Hankel recurrence

```text
H_{3,j-1}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_R = 0.          (core-lift)
```

Proof: since both complements have slope `lambda`,

```text
H_{2,j}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_{T_x}=0,
H_{2,j}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_{T_y}=0.
```

Writing

```text
ell_{T_x}=(X-x)ell_R,        ell_{T_y}=(X-y)ell_R,
```

and subtracting gives

```text
(y-x) H_{2,j}(Syn(w_lambda)) ell_R=0.
```

Thus rows `0` and `1` of the recurrence vanish on `ell_R`.  Combining this
with either equation for `(X-x)ell_R` also gives rows `1` and `2`.  Hence rows
`0,1,2` vanish on `ell_R`, which is (core-lift).

If

```text
H_{3,j-1}(Syn(phi)) ell_R != 0,
```

then the same slope is noncontained on the larger support `H\R`.  If this
direction vector is zero, the collision has moved into the contained/tangent
side on the core.  In both cases, a same-slope one-exchange collision is not a
free primitive packet: it is visible in the next-slack/core ledger.

## Exact Verifier

The script

```text
python3 experimental/scripts/verify_m1_hankel_t2_one_exchange_lift.py
```

checks the determinant gate against the slope-loop Hankel classifier and then
verifies the one-exchange core lift for every same-slope edge in two exact
tiny scans.

| field/domain | quotient pairs | supports | max bad | max primitive | max slope fiber | lifted one-exchange cores |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `F_5`, `H=F_5^*`, `n=4,k=1,a=3,j=1` | 15625 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 3480 |
| `F_7`, `H=F_7^*`, `n=6,k=3,a=5,j=1` | 117649 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 34650 |

In both scans every lifted core was still noncontained on the larger support:

```text
lifted_direction_zero_core_edges = 0.
```

These are small exact checks, not asymptotic evidence.  Their role is to make
the first `t=2` collision charge reproducible before moving to larger
`j>=2` packet scans.
