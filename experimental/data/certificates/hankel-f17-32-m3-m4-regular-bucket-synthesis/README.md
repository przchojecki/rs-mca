# F17^32 M3/M4 Regular-Bucket Synthesis

Status: AUDIT.

This directory composes the current M3/M4 regular-window lemmas for the pinned
row

```text
C = RS[F_17^32,H,256],    |H| = 512,
385 <= A <= 426.
```

It composes proved local certificates into a decision table for a regular pencil

```text
M_A(Z)=H_{t,j}(u)+Z H_{t,j}(v).
```

Closed by current lemmas:

```text
v=0 and rank H(u)=j+1:
  no finite affine roots;
  projective infinity is tangent/common-code-line paid.

v!=0, u=c v, and rank H(v)=j+1:
  the unique finite root z=-c is tangent/common-code-line paid;
  projective infinity is excluded.

u=0 and rank H(v)=j+1:
  the c=0 proportional subcase.
```

Finite-safe with projective kernel accounting:

```text
v!=0, u not proportional to v, rank H(v)<=6, and the finite regular bucket is
nonsingular:
  finite affine root count <=6 and has zero tangent overlap;
  projective infinity is empty or a one-point dimension-degree fallback by the
  M5 kernel-containment chart.
```

Still residual:

```text
rank-deficient finite regular buckets not covered by a paid family;
non-proportional finite buckets with direction rank >6 unless exact root
tables improve the bound;
quotient, extension, and subfield overlap for future non-proportional root
tables.
```

For projective samplers, a nonempty infinity kernel chart contributes the single
endpoint `[0:1]`.  Thus a finite-affine rank-`<=6` bucket is finite-budget safe,
but the projective sampler still needs either a smaller finite root table, an
endpoint payment, or a separate projective budget comparison.

This is not a worst-case row bound.  It is the current M4 decision table for
regular buckets after composing the proved local certificates.
