"""Verify the same-slope one-exchange root-slice algebra.

The mathematical lemma is linear.  If

    ell_{T_y} = (X-y) ell_R,

then

    ell_{T_y1} - ell_{T_y2} = (y2-y1) ell_R.

Consequently any linear row that kills both endpoint locators also kills
ell_R; substituting back then kills X ell_R.  This script checks that
identity exactly in small prime fields and stress-tests the row implication.
